    <h1 class="title">The Algorithm Scrolls On</h1>
    <section>
      <p class="line">Liam scrolls through Instagram.</p>
      <p class="line">The glow of his phone paints his face in cold blue light.</p>
      <p class="line">Each post promises a better home, a better life—perfectly staged rooms, smiling strangers in curated spaces.</p>
      <p class="line">The Algorithm whispers with every swipe: This could be yours.</p>
      <p class="line">AD: "Brighten your evenings with modern simplicity". Liam presses Buy Now.</p>
      <p class="line">Two days later, it stands in his living room - white, sleek and silent. Its glow feels less like warmth and more like surveillance.</p>
      <p class="line">The algorithm scrolls on. AD: "Handcrafted wood, authentic charm". The table arrives, heavy and sharp, with a foreign scent.</p>
      <p class="line">It looks very natural, but not for Liam.</p>
      <p class="line">The algorithm scrolls on. AD: "Luxury comfort, now 20% off."</p>
      <p class="line">When the sofa arrives, it consumes the room. Plush, rich, inviting. But he feels like a guest in his own house.</p>
      <p class="line">The algorithm scrolls on. AD: "Low maintenance. Maximum style". Little glass orbs sit on his windowsill, arranged like props on a set.</p>
      <p class="line">The algorithm scrolls on. AD: "Bold colours. Make a statement." Hung on his wall, it stares back at him. Demanding attention, drowning him out.</p>
      <p class="line">The algorithm scrolls on. AD: "Clean lines. Endless space for books you'll never read”. He assembles it late at night. When it stands tall, the room feels emptier, colder. Like it belongs to someone else.</p>
      <p class="line">The algorithm scrolls on. AD: "Timeless design. Transform your space". The rug unfurls, swallowing the floor.</p>
      <p class="line">Each step feels unknown. As though he's walking in someone else's shoes.</p>
      <p class="line">The algorithm scrolls on. AD: "Your home, but smarter." It arrives quickly, waiting for his voice. The house answers when he speaks. But he doesn't feel heard.</p>
      <p class="line">The algorithm scrolls on. The house is full now. Every corner, every shelf, every wall is dressed in someone else's choices.</p>
      <p class="line">Liam slumps into his velvet sofa. The rug beneath his feet feels cold. The lamp hums faintly. The bookshelf towers. The smart speaker blinks, listening.</p>
      <p class="line">The room looks perfect. It looks nothing like the place that Liam once called home.</p>
      <p class="line">And in that moment, he realises,</p>
      <p class="line">He is not who he was when he first opened the app.</p>
      <p class="line">The algorithm has not only furnished his house, it has furnished his identity.</p>
      <p class="line">But the phone still glows in his hand. Another post waits, eager for his thumb.</p>
      <p class="line">The screen goes black. For the first time, the house is silent.</p>
      <p class="line">Liam looks around, uneasy but free.</p>
      <p class="line">He tries to remember what he wanted before the feed told him who to be.</p>
      <p class="line">The algorithm waits in the dark, patient, certain he will return.</p>
      <p class="line">Liam’s house was never really his. Each item was chosen for him, not by him.</p>
      <p class="line">That’s what algorithms do: they don’t just shape your feed, they shape you.</p>
      <p class="line">The real danger isn’t buying things you don’t need,</p>
      <p class="line">It’s becoming someone you never chose to be.</p>
      <p class="line">So ask yourself: will you keep scrolling? Or will you put the phone down?</p>
